## 📋 **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue**: "Continue with Google" does nothing
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, likely need to enable Google Sign-In

### **Issue**: User created but no data in dashboard

**Solution**: Check Firestore `users` collection, should only have one admin

2. **Set up custom domain** in Firebase Hosting (optional)
3. **Configure environment variables** for production
4. **Test thoroughly** with real Google accounts
